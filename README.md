Fantasy Football Analyzer

Web app I built to analyze fantasy football projections and stats.

____________________________________________________________

Takes your projection CSV files and automatically calculates Value Over Replacement Player (VORP) based on your league settings. Also loads 2024 stats for comparison.

Main features:
- Auto-loads CSV files (`final_proj.csv` for projections, `prev_stats.csv` for stats)
- Calculates VORP and replacement levels by position
- Customizable scoring (PPR, standard, whatever)
- Works with any league size/roster setup
- Export filtered results back to CSV
